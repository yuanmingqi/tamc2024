# **Overview**

Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC) is a series of annual conferences that aims to bring together a wide range of researchers with interests in computational theory and its applications. These conferences have a strong interdisciplinary character and are distinguished by an appreciation of mathematical depth and scientific approaches.
 
Some of the most important theoretical aspects of a model of computation are its power, generality, simplicity, synthesizability, verifiability, and expressiveness. The TAMC series of conferences explore the algorithmic foundations, computational methods, and computing devices to meet the rapidly emerging challenges of complexity, scalability, sustainability, and interoperability, with wide-ranging impacts on virtually every aspect of human endeavor.
 
The TAMC conference series was initiated in 2004 in Beijing, China. Subsequent TAMC conferences have been held in Kunming, China (2004), Beijing, China (July 2006), Shanghai, China (2007), Xi'an, China (2008), Changsha, China, (2009), Prague, Czech Republic (2010), Tokyo, Japan (2011), Beijing, China (2012), Hong Kong, China (2013), Chennai, India (2014), Singapore (2015), Bern, Switzerland (2016, 2017), Kitakyushu, Japan (2019), Changsha, China (2020), Tianjin, China (2022).

In 2024, TAMC will return to Hong Kong as a fully offline conference. The conference will offer a platform for researchers interested in computational theory and applications to exchange ideas and present their work. The main themes of the conference are computability, algorithms, complexity, models of computation, and systems theory.

We look forward to welcoming you to Hong Kong in May 2024!
