Currently, quantum computing has entered a new stage of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Systems (NISQ), in which the synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits have become particularly important. Similar to the complexity of classical circuits, the complexity of quantum circuits also focuses on the optimization of circuit size and depth, while the metrics of quantum circuits are more complex, involving the number of auxiliary qubits, the levels used, and many other aspects. In this report, we will discuss a series of mathematical problems and research progress involved in the optimization of quantum circuits, and explore the connections between these problems and some classic famous problems such as Babai's conjecture about the diameter of Kaley graphs, etc.</p>"},{"location":"keynote_speakers/#title-on-the-finite-character-of-learnability-a-fundamental-theorem-of-supervised-learning","title":"Title: On the Finite Character of Learnability: A Fundamental Theorem of Supervised Learning","text":""},{"location":"keynote_speakers/#speaker-shang-hua-teng-university-of-southern-california-usa","title":"Speaker: Shang-Hua Teng, University of Southern California, USA","text":""},{"location":"keynote_speakers/#abstract_1","title":"Abstract:","text":"<p>Recent work on learning has yielded a striking result: the learnability of various problems can be undecidable, or independent of the standard ZFC axioms of set theory. Furthermore, the learnability of such problems can fail to be a property of finite character: informally, it cannot be detected by examining finite projections of the problem. On the other hand, learning theory abounds with notions of dimension that characterize learning and consider only finite restrictions of the problem, i.e., are properties of finite character. How can these results be reconciled? More precisely, which classes of learning problems are vulnerable to logical undecidability, and which are within the grasp of finite characterizations?</p> <p>We demonstrate that the difficulty of supervised learning with metric losses admits a tight finite characterization. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of learning a hypothesis class can be detected by examining its finite projections. For realizable and agnostic learning with respect to a wide class of proper loss functions, we demonstrate an exact compactness result: a class is learnable with a given sample complexity precisely when the same is true of all its finite projections. For realizable learning with improper loss functions, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. At the heart of our technical work is a compactness result concerning assignments of variables that maintain a class of functions below a target value, which generalizes Hall's classic matching theorem and may be of independent interest.</p> <p>Joint work with Julian Asilis, Siddartha Devic, Shaddin Dughmi, and Vatsal Sharan</p>"},{"location":"keynote_speakers/#title-lightweight-algorithms-to-learning-solutions-for-large-scale-maximization","title":"Title: Lightweight Algorithms to Learning Solutions for Large-scale Maximization","text":""},{"location":"keynote_speakers/#speaker-my-t-thai-university-of-florida-usa","title":"Speaker: My T.

Viral marketing stands as a prime example of this challenge, requiring strategies that transcend traditional combinatorial methods and embrace learning-based solutions. This keynote delves into the forefront of viral marketing optimization, exploring advanced algorithms that efficiently navigate the complexities of billion-scale networks. We begin with a (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm, enhanced with accelerated sampling frameworks, to offer near-exact solutions for this NP-hard problem. Expanding our scope to heterogeneous multiplex networks, we introduce combinatorial algorithms adept at capturing the intricate dynamics of overlapping user interactions. We further discuss a transformative framework designed to overcome fundamental obstacles inherent in traditional approaches, via the power of machine learning. Finally, the keynote concludes with MIM-Reasoner, which exploits the reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical models to effectively tackle viral marketing challenges across diverse platforms.</p>"},{"location":"program/","title":"PROGRAM","text":"<ul> <li> <p>On learning families of ideals in lattices and Boolean algebras</p> <p>Nikolay Bazhenov and Manat Mustafa </p> </li> <li> <p>Unambiguous and Co-Nondeterministic Computations of Finite Automata and Pushdown Automata Families and the Effects of Multiple Counters</p> <p>Tomoyuki Yamakami </p> </li> <li> <p>A Gray Code of Ordered Trees</p> <p>Shin-Ichi Nakano </p> </li> <li> <p>Mechanism Design with Predictions for Facility Location Games with Candidate Locations</p> <p>Jiazhu Fang, Qizhi Fang, Wenjing Liu and Qingqin Nong </p> </li> <li> <p>An Improved Approximation Algorithm for Metric Triangle Packing</p> <p>Jingyang Zhao and Mingyu Xiao </p> </li> <li> <p>An optimal and practical algorithm for the planar 2-center problem</p> <p>Xuehou Tan </p> </li> <li> <p>Endogenous Threshold Selection with Two-Interval Restricted Tests</p> <p>Zeyu Ren and Yan Liu </p> </li> <li> <p>An Improved Kernel and Parameterized Algorithm for Almost Induced Matching</p> <p>Yuxi Liu and Mingyu Xiao </p> </li> <li> <p>A Tight Threshold Bound for Search Trees with 2-way Comparisons</p> <p>Sunny Atalig and Marek Chrobak </p> </li> <li> <p>Kleene Theorems for Lasso and \u03c9-Languages</p> <p>Mike Cruchten </p> </li> <li> <p>Tight Double Exponential Lower Bounds</p> <p>Ivan Bliznets and Markus Hecher </p> </li> <li> <p>Source-Oblivious Broadcast</p> <p>Pierre Fraigniaud and Hovhannes Harutyunyan </p> </li> <li> <p>On the 3-Tree Core of Plane Graphs</p> <p>Debajyoti Mondal and Md.
